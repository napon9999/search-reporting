How many of your users are clicking on the first search result?  How many refine their search?  How many use the Advanced search capabilities?  How many click on a cached link?  How many have to click the Next page link?  How many aren't finding what they want?

Introducing Advanced Search Reporting for your Google Mini or Google Search Appliance.  Through a detailed analysis of what your users are clicking, you can now extract volumes of rich behavior detail that you can use to improve your search quality and their search experience.

You can also use the forum to ask questions, hear about new experiments that are coming, and suggest ideas for new experiments!
